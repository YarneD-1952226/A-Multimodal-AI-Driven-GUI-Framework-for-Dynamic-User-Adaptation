\section{Summary of the Work}
This thesis designed and evaluated a multimodal AI-driven GUI framework that adapts user interfaces in real time. The goal was to support personalised and accessible experiences, especially in health contexts where users may have motor, visual, or hands free constraints. The framework captures touch, keyboard, voice, and gesture inputs and turns them into concrete adaptation actions via \emph{Smart Intent Fusion} (SIF).

The architecture has three modular layers: an \textbf{Input Adapter} that standardises events and handles basic management, a \textbf{SIF Backend} that combines rules with LLM-driven reasoning, and a \textbf{Frontend} that renders the UI and applies adaptations. A key addition is \textbf{Multi-Agent SIF} (MA-SIF): separate specialists for UI, geometry, and input, with a Validator Agent to reconcile and validate outputs. This setup reduced hallucinations, improved reliability, and stayed easy to configure through an external JSON file. SIF first started from a single-agent LLM and moved to MA-SIF after seeing prompt creep and uneven JSON adherence; splitting roles plus validation made outputs more predictable without sacrificing adaptability.

\paragraph{Research Objectives and Outcomes}
To reach the overall goal, six concrete objectives were set. Each is briefly restated with its outcome.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Develop a modular, cross-platform architecture.}  
  A three-layer framework (Frontend, Input Adapter, Backend) was implemented with a shared JSON-based event and adaptation format. It integrates with Flutter today and keeps a clear path for SwiftUI and Unity through the same contracts.

  \item \textbf{Implement multimodal input fusion.}  
  Touch, keyboard, voice, and gesture inputs are supported and logged in a unified event schema. The pipeline fuses these with profile data and history, enabling context-aware adaptations across modalities.

  \item \textbf{Integrate Smart Intent Fusion (SIF).}  
  A hybrid engine was built that blends deterministic rules with multi-agent LLM reasoning (MA-SIF). The Validator Agent enforces schema, removes duplicates, and prevents conflicts, which yields high internal coherence (DCI $\approx$ \textbf{0.995}; Table~\ref{tab:obj-metrics}).

  \item \textbf{Deliver accessibility-focused adaptations.}  
  The system consistently proposes accessibility actions: \textbf{97.51\%} of all suggestions target motor, visual, or hands free needs (Table~\ref{tab:overall-accessible-share}). Typical changes include enlarging targets, increasing contrast and font size, and switching interaction modes.

  \item \textbf{Provide a developer-friendly integration path.}  
  The framework exposes simple contracts and reusable patterns; adapters apply changes on the client with minimal glue code. Configuration lives in JSON and can be swapped without redeploying the app.

  \item \textbf{Evaluate system performance and impact.}  
  A feasibility study over \textbf{84 events} across \textbf{six profiles} assessed adaptation quality and latency. In the balanced configuration, median latency is \textbf{13.19\,s}, schema-valid outputs \textbf{84.52\%}, and profile–action alignment (top five actions) \textbf{55.22\%}. A heavier configuration raises schema-valid to \textbf{100.00\%} and PAA to \textbf{61.45\%}, at \textbf{36.06\,s} median latency (Tables~\ref{tab:cfg-compare-overall}–\ref{tab:cfg-compare-profiles}).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Summary of Contributions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Modular, cross-platform architecture:} Designed to work across Flutter and SwiftUI, with a clear path to future platforms such as Unity/VR through shared JSON contracts.
    \item \textbf{Smart Intent Fusion (SIF):} A hybrid engine that mixes deterministic rules with multi-agent LLM reasoning for ambiguous cases.
    \item \textbf{MA-SIF extension:} Specialist agents (UI/geometry/input) plus a Validator Agent for conflict resolution and schema adherence, yielding high coherence (DCI $\approx$ 0.995).
    \item \textbf{Developer-friendly integration:} Consistent contracts for events, adaptations, and profiles; minimal glue code; configuration in JSON.
    \item \textbf{Accessibility focus (empirical):} \textbf{97.51\%} of actions are accessibility targeted; strong performance on common motor/voice issues and moderate personalisation that improves under the heavy configuration.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations}
Current limitations include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LLM API dependency:} Cloud models require connectivity and are subject to quota and availability.
    \item \textbf{Synthetic evaluation:} Results come from structured profiles and tasks; a user study is still needed to capture acceptance and perceived control.
    \item \textbf{UI context awareness:} Reasoning relies on predefined metadata; there is no live semantic understanding of layouts yet.
    \item \textbf{Latency:} Multi-agent LLM reasoning adds seconds of delay, which may not suit highly time-critical flows.
    \item \textbf{Privacy and cost:} Multimodal logging can be sensitive and cloud inference can be costly; production systems need strict telemetry controls and efficiency measures.
\end{itemize}
These constraints make the current prototype best suited for exploratory deployments rather than safety-critical settings. Dependence on a cloud LLM introduces availability risks; if the model stalls or rate-limits, behaviour regresses to rules. The evaluation, while systematic, is based on scripted scenarios and may miss edge cases. Without a live UI model, layout nuances can be overlooked. Latency is noticeable for highly interactive flows. Finally, rich logging raises privacy and cost concerns. Near-term mitigations include progressive enhancement (rules first, MA-SIF second), batching and caching, rate-aware fallbacks, on-device redaction, and a UI analyser to bridge the context gap.

\section{Lessons Learned}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hybrid $>$ pure AI.} Rules keep the interface responsive; MA-SIF adds smarter, profile-aware changes moments later.
    \item \textbf{Schemas are leverage.} Stable JSON contracts made the system portable and easy to debug as components evolved.
    \item \textbf{Prompts and validation matter.} Constraint-focused prompts plus a Validator Agent improved output quality and reduced contradictions.
    \item \textbf{Simulation helps.} Synthetic profiles and events were enough to tune latency limits, prompts, and fallback behaviour before involving real users.
    \item \textbf{Modularity reduces risk.} Loose coupling made it straightforward to swap models and modalities and points to a clear path toward UI-aware vision and on-device reasoning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation Results: Conclusion}
The Adaptive Smart Home Controller shows that the framework can deliver valid, accessibility-focused adaptations in real time. Across \textbf{84 events} and six profiles, the balanced configuration reached \textbf{84.52\%} schema-valid responses (i.e., final payloads that pass the strict JSON schema), with \textbf{100\%} of responses flowing through the Validator Agent. \textbf{97.51\%} of suggested actions were accessibility targeted (Table~\ref{tab:overall-accessible-share}), and internal coherence was high (DCI $\approx$ \textbf{0.995}; Table~\ref{tab:obj-metrics}).

Effectiveness is strong on common motor and voice cases: \emph{missed tap} and \emph{slider overshoot} reached \textbf{100\%} ERA, and \emph{voice command} \textbf{97.22\%}; gestures remain the main opportunity for improvement (\textbf{8.33\%}; Table~\ref{tab:era-by-event}). Personalisation is moderate overall (PAA \textbf{55.22\%} on the top five actions) and highest for combined needs (P4, P5), which aligns with the action mix. Latency under MA-SIF (balanced) is \textbf{13.19\,s} median (p90 \textbf{17.13\,s}, max \textbf{21.10\,s}), which suits asynchronous adaptation. The heavier configuration increases schema validity to \textbf{100.00\%} and raises alignment to \textbf{61.45\%} at \textbf{36.06\,s} median latency (Tables~\ref{tab:cfg-compare-overall}–\ref{tab:cfg-compare-profiles}), making the trade-off explicit.

A rules-only engine did \emph{not} outperform this setup. Overlap with the final LLM+Validator sets was limited (Jaccard $\sim$0.25–0.35 overall; exact matches $\sim$1\%), and rules missed multi-action bundles and need-aware choices (Table~\ref{tab:rule-vs-llm-compact}). That said, a rule \emph{fast path} is still useful: in about \textbf{86\%} of events there is at least one canonical corrective action available (aggregated from Table~\ref{tab:era-by-event}), so emitting that immediately and letting the Validator consolidate afterwards can lower median latency without sacrificing quality.

Overall, the combination of rules + MA-SIF + validation produced predictable outputs without sacrificing adaptability. The next step is a small, focused user study to measure acceptance and perceived control, and to validate that the balanced configuration offers the right quality–latency point in practice. Beyond that, UI-aware action variants and light feedback signals are expected to lift personalisation for single-need profiles while keeping coherence and latency within bounds.

\section{Self-Reflection and Reflection on the Work}

This project taught me how to turn an ambitious idea about multimodal adaptive interfaces into a working system through many small steps. I learned that a hybrid approach works best. Simple rules keep the interface responsive, while LLM reasoning adds context aware changes. Stable JSON contracts were a key part of the design because they gave every layer a shared language and made testing and extension much easier. I also learned to write clear prompts and to validate every result with a strict schema so that the output stays reliable and useful.

I solved core challenges such as standardising events across input types, using WebSocket for fast feedback and HTTP for profile management, and reducing hallucinations with a multi agent setup and a strong Validator Agent. Some things were out of scope for now, such as live semantic understanding of the UI, very low latency on device models, and large user studies. Because of these limits the system is ready for exploration and demos rather than strict time critical or safety critical use.

This work also provided me with insights into future directions. A UI analyser that uses visual input or a widget tree would let the backend reason over the real screen. Light domain specific models that run on device could lower latency a lot. Studies with people who have motor or visual impairments would show real effects and acceptance. Privacy by design logging and redaction at the edge would make the system safer for sensitive data.

My process improved as I narrowed the scope. By iterating on a small end to end pipeline from adapter to backend to frontend I got faster feedback and clearer priorities. Simulated profiles and scripted events were enough to tune latency budgets, prompts, and fallbacks before involving real users. I also made progress measurable with schema checks, logging, and small comparisons instead of guesswork.

I learned that I work well between research and engineering. I enjoyed turning ideas like MA-SIF and its agents into robust code. I also learned to avoid trying to do everything at once. A focused first version and clear contracts helped me move fast without losing quality. I became more precise in writing prompts, planning for failure with timeouts and fallbacks, and stating privacy and cost assumptions. I also learned to accept uncertainty since LLM systems do not always behave in predictable ways. By evaluating the system more and more, I came to conclusion that this has real potential for improving user experience.

Looking back, the main aims were met. The system delivers real time adaptations, fuses multimodal intent, and stays friendly for developers. Rules give quick feedback and MA-SIF adds richer changes. The main gaps are latency and deep context awareness. These are not failures but a roadmap. On device inference, semantic UI analysis, and real world studies are the next steps.

\section{Final Remarks}
This thesis shows that \textbf{Smart Intent Fusion}, in a multi-agent setup with a Validator, delivers \emph{reliable, accessibility-focused} adaptation at interactive pace. In the six-profile, 84-event study, almost all suggestions targeted accessibility goals (97.51\%), internal coherence was high (DCI $\approx$ 0.995), and the balanced configuration kept median latency near 13\,s. Effectiveness was near-perfect on common motor/voice cases (missed tap, slider overshoot, voice command), with gestures marked as the main opportunity for refinement.

A key outcome is that a \emph{rules-only} policy did not outperform this architecture. Overlap with the final LLM+Validator sets stayed modest (Jaccard $\sim$0.25–0.35; exact matches $\sim$1\%), and rules missed multi-action bundles and need-aware choices that lift personalisation. At the same time, the data support a practical compromise: in $\sim$86\% of events there is at least one canonical rule fix available, so a \emph{fast path} can emit that immediately while MA-SIF and the Validator consolidate the full, profile-aware adaptation a moment later. In short, rules help with speed; the hybrid pipeline wins on coverage, composition, and alignment.

Looking ahead, there is some work to do: package the adapter and contracts as SDKs (Flutter, SwiftUI, future Unity/VR), add offline and privacy-preserving modes, and ground decisions in real UI context via widget trees and vision. A small user study with motor-, visual-, and hands-free participants will turn feasibility into user-level evidence (acceptance, perceived control). Beyond that, UI-aware action variants and light feedback signals can raise personalisation for single-need profiles without sacrificing coherence or latency.

Treat UIs as programmable surfaces, fuse multimodal intent, and validate before acting. With that recipe, interfaces move from static screens to adaptive systems that are personalised, inclusive, and resilient to the diversity of human interaction.
