# A Multimodal AI-Driven GUI Framework for Dynamic User Adaptation

## Objective

This thesis presents a generalized, modular, and scalable framework for dynamic user interface (UI) adaptation, enabling real-time, personalized UI enhancements across diverse platforms (Flutter, React, SwiftUI, and future Unity) and domains (accessibility, gaming, smart homes). The framework leverages multimodal inputs (touch, keyboard, voice, gestures) to capture rich user interaction context, processed by a large language model (LLM) and rule-based logic to deliver intelligent, accessibility-focused adaptations. The novel **Smart Intent Fusion** feature uses the LLM to fuse multimodal inputs, infer user intent, and propose predefined UI adaptations, enhancing accessibility and usability. Designed to be developer-friendly, the framework minimizes integration effort through a cross-platform SDK and is extensible to future modalities (e.g., eye tracking) and on-device AI models. The thesis positions AI-driven UI adaptation as an emerging research area, with LLMs as a stepping stone 
toward specialized models that dynamically rewrite UI code, a future challenge.

"Let’s have an AI system that understands the multimodal user context (gesture, layout, gaze, etc.), and adapts the GUI dynamically — on the fly — to improve the UX for this specific user, in this specific moment."

## Architecture Overview

The framework is input- and output-agnostic, with an optional analyzing module for dynamic UI inspection. The data flow is:

**Frontend → Input Adapter Layer (with Optional Analyzing Module) → AI Backend Logic (with User Profiles & History) → Frontend (for Adaptations)**

### Data Flow

1. **Frontend**: Renders a cross-platform UI, captures multimodal interactions (touch, keyboard, voice, gestures), and applies AI-driven adaptations (e.g., button enlargement).
2. **Input Adapter Layer**: Unifies multimodal inputs and optional UI metadata into standardized context events, adhering to a strict JSON contract.
3. **AI Backend Logic**: Combines rule-based logic, LLM-driven **Smart Intent Fusion**, heatmap analysis, user profiles, and historical data to generate personalized adaptation actions.
4. **Frontend (Feedback)**: Applies adaptations, logs outcomes, and feeds back to the backend for continuous learning.

## Components

### 1. Frontend Layer

- **Purpose**: Renders a consistent UI across platforms, captures multimodal interactions, and applies dynamic adaptations from the backend. Focused on 3 main UI elements Scrollable card list, buttons and text blocks.
- **Platforms**:
  - **Flutter (Desktop/Mobile/web)**: main code base
  - **SwiftUI (Apple)**: contrast code base
  - **Future (VR/AR)**: Unity
- **Test UI Design**:
  - **Structure**: Art explorer
  - **Inputs**:
    - **Touch/Tap (Standard)**: Taps and miss-taps on buttons/cards, detecting errors (e.g., motor issues). Implemented via `GestureDetector` (Flutter), `onClick` (React), `.onTapGesture` (SwiftUI).
    - **Keyboard (Standard)**: `Tab` for navigation, `Enter` for selection, supporting motor-impaired users. Implemented via `RawKeyboardListener` (Flutter), `onKeyDown` (React), `.onKeyPress` (SwiftUI).
    - **Voice (Advanced)**: Commands (e.g., “play,” “next”) via speech-to-text for hands-free interaction. Implemented via `speech_to_text` (Flutter), Web Speech API (React), AVSpeechRecognizer (SwiftUI). Simulated via mock inputs if SDK setup is delayed.
    - **Gestures (Advanced)**: Hand gestures (e.g., point → select, swipe → scroll) via MediaPipe for natural/VR interaction. Implemented via `flutter_mediapipe` (Flutter), MediaPipe.js (React), custom bindings (SwiftUI). Simulated via mock events if integration exceeds sprint timeline.
  - **Behaviors (Adaptations)**:
    - **Standard (Cross-Platform)**:
      - **Increase Size**: Enlarges UI elements (e.g., buttons, text) for motor/visual impairments (e.g., `{"action": "increase_size", "target": "button", "value": 1.5}`).
      - **Reposition Element**: Moves elements closer to interaction points (e.g., `{"action": "move_closer", "target": "button", "offset": {"x": 20, "y": 0}}`).
      - **Increase Contrast**: Adjusts colors for readability (e.g., `{"action": "increase_contrast", "target": "button", "mode": "high"}`).
      - **Adjust Scroll Speed**: Reduces scroll speed for motor-impaired users (e.g., `{"action": "adjust_scroll_speed", "target": "scrollview", "value": 0.015}`).
      - **Mode Switching**: Switches to voice navigation on repeated miss-taps (e.g., `{"action": "switch_mode", "mode": "voice"}`). Simulated via mock backend responses if voice SDK setup is delayed. 
    - **Platform-Exclusive**:
      - **Flutter**: Smooth animations (e.g., `AnimatedScale` for button scaling).
      - **SwiftUI**: Haptic feedback (e.g., `UIImpactFeedbackGenerator` for button taps).
      - **Unity (Future)**: 3D object manipulation (e.g., `transform.localScale`) + sticky effect.
  - **Outputs**:
    - Interaction data (taps, keyboard presses, voice commands, gestures) for backend processing.
    - Optional UI metadata (e.g., button sizes, positions) via analyzing module.
  - **Developer Integration**:
    - Use SDK with pre-built UI templates and event hooks (e.g., `AdaptiveUI.sendEvent`).
    - Example (Flutter):
      ```dart
      AdaptiveUI.sendEvent('tap', element: 'button', coordinates: event.position, userId: 'user_123');
      AdaptiveUI.sendEvent('voice', command: 'info', confidence: 0.9, userId: 'user_123');
      ```
    - Minimal setup: 5–10 lines per platform for standard inputs; advanced inputs (voice, gestures) enabled via SDK config (e.g., `enableVoice: true`).

---

### 2. Input Adapter Layer

- **Purpose**: Unifies multimodal inputs and optional UI metadata into standardized context events, enabling LLM-driven **Smart Intent Fusion** for dynamic adaptations.
- **Inputs**:
  - **Touch/Tap**: Taps/miss-taps on buttons/cards to detect interactions/errors.
  - **Keyboard**: `Tab`/`Enter` for navigation/selection.
  - **Voice**: Commands (e.g., “play”) via speech-to-text. Simulated if SDK integration is delayed.
  - **Gestures**: Hand gestures (e.g., point, swipe) via MediaPipe. Simulated via mock events if integration exceeds sprint.
  - **Future**: Eye tracking -> webgazer.js, bio-signals.
  - **Optional Metadata**: UI structure (e.g., button sizes) from analyzing module.
- **Processing**:
  - Converts raw inputs to context events using a strict JSON contract.
  - Enriches events with `user_id`, timestamps, confidence scores, and metadata (e.g., gesture type).
  - Detects patterns (e.g., miss-tap if coordinates miss target).
- **JSON Contract**:
  ```json
  {
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["event_type", "source", "timestamp", "user_id"],
    "properties": {
      "event_type": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["tap", "miss_tap", "key_press", "voice", "gesture"]
      },
      "source": {
        "type": "string",
        "enum": ["touch", "keyboard", "voice", "gesture"]
      },
      "timestamp": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
      "user_id": { "type": "string" },
      "target_element": { "type": "string" },
      "coordinates": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": { "x": { "type": "number" }, "y": { "type": "number" } }
      },
      "confidence": { "type": "number", "minimum": 0, "maximum": 1 },
      "metadata": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "command": { "type": "string" }, // e.g., "play"
          "gesture_type": { "type": "string" }, // e.g., "swipe"
          "key": { "type": "string" } // e.g., "Enter"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- **Smart Intent Fusion (LLM-Driven Feature)**:
  - **Purpose**: Fuses multimodal inputs (e.g., voice “play” + miss-tap) to infer intent and suggest proactive adaptations (e.g., trigger button, enlarge it).
  - **Process**:
    - Combines inputs, user profiles (e.g., motor impairment), and history (e.g., frequent miss-taps).
    - Uses LLM to reason (e.g., “Given user_123 with motor impairment, miss_tap near button_play, and voice ‘play,’ suggest adaptation”).
    - Response: `{"action": "increase_size", "target": "button_play", "value": 1.5, "secondary_action": "trigger_button"}`.
  - **Examples**:
    - **Accessibility**: Miss-tap + voice “play” → enlarge button, trigger action.
  - **Value**:
    - **Intent Clarity**: Voice/gestures clarify vague inputs (e.g., point + “play” = select Play).
    - **Behavioral Insight**: Shaky gestures indicate motor issues, triggering accessibility adaptations.
    - **Novelty**: LLM’s proactive adaptations (e.g., switch to voice mode) go beyond static rules.
  - **Implementation**:
    - SDK provides adapters for voice (`speech_to_text`, Web Speech API) and gestures (MediaPipe). Simulated via mock events if setup exceeds sprint.
    - Developers call `sendEvent` with raw or library outputs (e.g., `{"event_type": "gesture", "gesture_type": "swipe"}`).
    - Backend validates events and processes via LLM/rules.
- **Developer Notes**:
  - Minimal effort: 1 line per event for standard inputs; advanced inputs via SDK config.
  - JSON contract ensures extensibility for new modalities.
  - Analyzing module (optional) provides UI metadata (e.g., button sizes).

### 3. Smart Intent Fusion (SIF)

- **Purpose**: Generates adaptation actions using rule-based logic, LLM-driven reasoning and intent inference, optional heatmap analysis, user profiles, and historical UI interaction data.
- **Components**:
  - **Rule-Based Logic**: Deterministic adaptations (e.g., `if miss_tap then increase_size`).
    - Config: `{"condition": "miss_tap", "action": "increase_size", "value": 1.5}`
  - **LLM Reasoning**: Fuses history of inputs and profiles to infer intent and suggest creative adaptations (e.g., switch to voice mode).
  - **Heatmap Analysis**: Prioritizes targets based on interaction density (e.g., frequent taps on “Play”). Simulated via mock data
  - **User Profiles & History**:
    - **Content**:
      - `user_id`: Unique identifier (e.g., UUID).
      - `accessibility_needs`: Booleans (e.g., `motor_impaired: true`, `visual_impaired: false`, `hands_free_preferred: true`).
      - `input_preferences`: Preferred modality (e.g., “voice”).
      - `interaction_history`: Past events (e.g., `[{event_type: "miss_tap", timestamp: "..."}]`), adaptation outcomes (e.g., `[{action: "increase_size", success: true}]`).
      - `ui_preferences`: Font size (e.g., 18), contrast mode (e.g., “high”), button size (e.g., 1.2).
      - Example user profile:
        ```json
        {
          "user_id": "user_123",
          "accessibility_needs": {
            "motor_impaired": true,
            "visual_impaired": false,
            "hands_free_preferred": true
          },
          "input_preferences": {
            "preferred_modality": "voice",
          },
          "ui_preferences": {
            "font_size": 18,
            "contrast_mode": "normal",
            "button_size": 1.2
          }
        }
        ```
        Example UI interaction history:
        ```json
        {
        "interaction_history": [
            {"event_type": "miss_tap", "target_element": "button_play", "timestamp": "2025-07-22T12:00:00Z"},
            {"event_type": "tap", "target_element": "button_info", "timestamp": "2025-07-22T12:01:00Z"}
          ],
        }
        ```
    - **Use**:
      - Personalizes adaptations (e.g., larger buttons for motor_impaired: true).
      - Provides LLM context for intent inference (e.g., prioritize voice for hands_free_preferred).
      - Updates history for continuous learning (e.g., frequent miss-taps → permanent size increase).
  - **Endpoints (FastAPI)**:
    - `/context`: Receives events, returns actions (e.g., `{"action": "increase_size", "target": "button_play"}`).
    - `/profile`: Manages user profiles.
    - `/modalities`: Configures supported inputs.
    - `/ws/adapt`: WebSocket for real-time adaptations (optional, simulated if needed).
  - **Logging**: Stores events and adaptations in `adaptation_log.jsonl` (e.g., `{"timestamp": "...", "context": {...}, "action": {...}}`). Uses MongoDB for scalability in production.

## Future Work

The current framework uses LLMs to infer intent and suggest predefined adaptations, proving the concept of AI-driven UI adaptation within the constraints of 2025 technology. Future advancements could enable specialized AI models to dynamically rewrite UI code, a transformative but complex goal:

- **Specialized UI-Adapting AI Models**:
  - **Vision**: Develop lightweight AI models trained to generate stable, platform-specific UI code (e.g., Flutter widgets, React components) in real-time based on user context (e.g., motor impairments, voice commands).
  - **Capabilities**:
    - Dynamically rewrite UI codebases (e.g., adjust Flutter widget trees) for hyper-personalized adaptations.
    - Integrate multimodal inputs (touch, voice, gestures, eye tracking) and user profiles to propose creative solutions (e.g., redesign layouts for elderly users).
    - Run on-device for low-latency, privacy-preserving adaptations, reducing cloud dependency.
  - **Feasibility with Current Technology**:
    - **Possible**: Fine-tuning existing LLMs (e.g., CodeLlama) on curated datasets of UI codebases and interaction patterns could produce a prototype generating simple UI changes (e.g., CSS styles, widget parameters). Tools like MediaPipe and on-device inference frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow Lite) support multimodal input processing.
    - **Challenges**: 
      - **Dataset Scarcity**: No large-scale dataset exists for UI code paired with multimodal interactions and adaptation outcomes. Creating one requires months of data collection and annotation.
      - **Training Complexity**: Generating stable, platform-specific code in milliseconds demands advanced architectures (e.g., transformer-based code synthesis, graph neural networks) and significant compute resources.
      - **Stability and Safety**: Generated code must be bug-free and respect platform constraints, requiring robust validation pipelines.
      - **Real-Time Inference**: Achieving millisecond latency for on-device UI changes is cutting-edge, requiring model optimization (e.g., quantization, pruning).
    - **PhD-Level Scope**: Building such a model is feasible but requires 2–3 years of research, including dataset creation, model training, and integration with UI frameworks. This aligns with PhD-level challenges in AI-driven software engineering and HCI.
  - **Impact**: Specialized models could revolutionize accessibility, gaming, and smart homes by enabling seamless, personalized UI adaptations. The current framework’s use of LLMs for predefined behaviors lays the foundation for this future research.
- **Real-Time WebSocket Streaming**: Enable low-latency adaptations for immersive applications (e.g., VR).
- **Unity VR/AR Support**: Add hand/poke interactions for gaming and immersive environments.
- **Additional Modalities**: Integrate eye tracking, bio-signals for richer context.
- **Cloud-Based Microservices**: Scale backend for production-grade apps.

## Developer Workload & Integration

- **Setup**:
  - Integrate SDK with pre-built UI template and event hooks (5–10 lines per platform).
  - Enable standard inputs (touch, keyboard) via `sendEvent`.
  - Enable voice/gestures via SDK config (e.g., `enableVoice: true`) and library outputs (e.g., MediaPipe). Simulate if setup exceeds sprint.
- **Extending Modalities**:
  - Pass new input data (e.g., eye-tracking coordinates) to `sendEvent` with `metadata`.
  - JSON contract ensures backend compatibility.
- **Mitigation**:
  - SDK abstracts complexity (e.g., gesture processing via MediaPipe).
  - Analyzing module reduces manual metadata tagging.
  - API docs define contract fields and adaptation formats.
- **Example (Flutter)**:
  ```dart
  GestureDetector(
    onTapDown: (details) => AdaptiveUI.sendEvent(
      'tap',
      element: 'button_play',
      coordinates: details.globalPosition,
      userId: 'user_123',
    ),
    child: ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {},
      child: Text("Play"),
    ),
  )
  ```

## Thesis Focus: Novelty of LLM-Driven GUI Adaptation

The thesis centers on the transformative potential of LLMs (and future specialized AI models) to dynamically adapt GUIs based on multimodal inputs and user profiles in an emerging research area. **Smart Intent Fusion** enables the LLM to:
- **Infer Intent**: Combine inputs (e.g., voice “play” + miss-tap) to understand user goals (e.g., trigger Play button).
- **Propose Creative Adaptations**: Suggest proactive changes (e.g., enlarge button, switch to voice mode) beyond static rules.
- **Personalize via Profiles**: Use user data (e.g., motor impairment) and history (e.g., frequent miss-taps) to tailor adaptations.
- **Enhance Accessibility**: Improve usability for motor-impaired, visually impaired, or hands-free users.
- **Future Vision**: Specialized on-device AI models could generate real-time, stable UI code (e.g., Flutter widgets), a PhD-level challenge requiring advanced training and integration. The current framework proves the concept using LLMs, laying the foundation for this future research.
